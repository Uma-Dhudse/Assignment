    "Ans - Ans - In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that is defined using the def keyword and \n",
    "can be called by its name to perform a specific task. Functions are usually defined outside of \n",
    "classes and are not associated with any object. They take input (arguments), process it, and may \n",
    "return a result. \n",
    "On the other hand, a method is a function that is associated with an object. Methods are defined \n",
    "inside a class and are called using the dot (.) operator on an object. They can access and modify \n",
    "the data of the object they belong to. \n",
    "In simple terms, all methods are functions, but not all functions are methods. The main \n",
    "difference is that methods are called on objects and often operate on the data within those \n",

    "Ans: In Python, a function can be defined in two main ways: by using the def keyword or by using a \n",

    "1. Using the def keyword: \n",
    "This is the most common way to define a function. The def keyword is followed by the \n",

    "In Python, an iterator is an object that allows you to traverse through all the elements of a \n",

    "Generators offer several advantages over regular functions, especially when dealing with large \n",

    "1. Memory Efficiency: \n",
    "Generators do not store the entire sequence in memory. They generate values one at a \n",
    "time using the yield keyword, which saves memory when handling large data. \n",
    "2. Faster Performance for Large Data: \n",
    "Since values are generated on the fly, generators are faster and more efficient for \n",
    "processing large or infinite data sequences compared to regular functions that return a full \n",
    "list. \n",
    "3. Lazy Evaluation: \n",
    "Generators use lazy evaluation, which means values are only computed when needed. \n",
    "This reduces unnecessary computation and improves performance. \n",
    "4. Simpler Code: \n",
    "Generators help write cleaner and simpler code using loops and yield, avoiding the need \n",
    "to manage large lists or temporary storage manually. \n",
    "5. Infinite Sequences: \n",
